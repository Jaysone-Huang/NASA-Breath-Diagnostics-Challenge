# NASA-Breath-Diagnostics-Challenge
The objective of this challenge is to develop a diagnostic model by using NASA E-Nose data gathered from exhaled breath of 63 volunteers in a COVID-19 study.  Challenge participants will use advanced data preparation and AI techniques to overcome the limited sample size of subjects in the COVID-19 study.
